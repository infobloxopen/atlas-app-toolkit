package version

// this is structured after version pkg in kubernetes project, but stripped out deprecated fields

// Base version information.
//
// This is the fallback data used when version information from git is not
// provided via go ldflags. It provides an approximation of the
// version for ad-hoc builds (e.g. `go build`) that cannot get the version
// information from git.
//
// If you are looking at these fields in the git tree, they look
// strange. They are modified on the fly by the build process. The
// in-tree values are dummy values used for "git archive", which also
// works for GitHub tar downloads.
//
// When releasing a new Kubernetes version, this file is updated by
// build/mark_new_version.sh to reflect the new version, and then a
// git annotated tag (using format vX.Y where X == Major version and Y
// == Minor version) is created to point to the commit that updates
// pkg/version/base.go
